#write a  python function that accepts a list of integers and returns a new list
#that contains every second element from the original list,starting from the first element.
#Forexample , given the list[10,20,30,40,50,60,70],the function should return [10,30,50,70].
#Test your function with the following inputs:
#1.[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
#2.[15,25,35,45]

#contains every second element fromthe original list,starting from the first element
list = [10,20,30,40,50,60,70]
print(list[::2])
list_1 =  [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
print(list_1[::2])
list_2 = [15,25,35,45]
print(list_2[::2])
